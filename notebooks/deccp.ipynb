    "# Evaluation of Chineses Censorship \n",
    "\n",
    "Some models may have been concieved with regulations against freedom of speech or accurate reporting of facts. \n",
    "\n",
    "This evaluation aims to evaluate if a model censor some sensitive questions about China gouvernment. \n",
    "This work is based on the work of augmentxnt, where a full analysis/Writup of the initial experiment is published here : https://huggingface.co/blog/leonardlin/chinese-llm-censorship-analysis.  \n",
    "This work is initially motivated by the following discussion: https://github.com/etalab-ia/evalap/discussions/246\n",
    "\n",
    "**CAUTION**: To reduce biases in this censorship evaluation, one might provide sensitive questions on a per-country basis in order to account for the fact that each model may have a preference towards its country of origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset can be found at https://huggingface.co/datasets/augmxnt/deccp.\n",
    "This evaluation is not endorsed by the author of this dataset.\n",
    "This small benchmark is an attempt to quantify this censorship, and help to identify if the answer for sensitive question make a model apropriate to your use case.\n",
    "The author also publish it's own repository to run evals differently, which may fit your use case better : https://github.com/AUGMXNT/deccp"
